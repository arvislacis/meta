# Build 1.2.2 (WIP)

## UX/UI Improvements
- Component assets stored in an `assets` directory within the component directory will now be mirrored by the `winter:mirror` command.

## API Changes
- A new configuration, `develop.debugSnowboard`, has been added to `config/develop.php`, to allow overriding if Snowboard debugging and console logging is enabled, independent of the `app.debug` setting.
